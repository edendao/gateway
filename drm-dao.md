# üèî DRM DAO

**A DRM DAO is a coordinated flow of strategic capital to advance the heroic efforts to regenerate the planet.**

The first DRM DAO is the DRM Syndicate. The DRM Syndicate is community first. Everybody gets in at the same ground floor.&#x20;

A simple 1 USDC = 1 ‚ú∫DRM.

Join the front lines of climate change. [$DRM to join DRM Syndicate.](https://app.syndicate.io/clubs/0x99d61e194b0b677fa0a8215ad00d852cddd4cd9f)

## **DRM Syndicate**

_DRM tokens can be bought with USDC and governance tokens fractionalizing the holdings of the DRM Syndicate Gnosis Safe, which will literally just represent carbon credits._

We've partnered with carbon marketplace [Patch.io](https://patch.io) to curate a set of tier-1 quality projects in the industry. These projects have the scarcest and most valuable carbon removals in the industry. 100% of funds will be used to purchase carbon from Patch, up to $10M.&#x20;

Furthermore, we will only be purchasing from projects independently assessed by [(carbon)plan](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database), the leader in improving the transparency and scientific integrity of carbon removal and climate solutions through open data and tools.

_$8M would buy out Patch's entire inventory and make the DRM Syndicate top-tier global carbon remover. Here's a_ [_Google Sheet_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jiElyB-OKDGf3chlzMPM7gy3DpYs9F3KD6sShlnyK5E/edit#gid=0) _of project pricing and value (permanence in years)._

### Success means...

1. Raising $10M to become a top-tier carbon remover (Arguably #1)
2. Commissioning a Badge of Honor NFT exclusively for DRM Syndicate members
3. Celebrating with an in-person event
