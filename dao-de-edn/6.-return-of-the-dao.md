### The Way of the Eden Daoist

The Eden Daoists unite against Moloch by financing carbon removal hyperscale.

Eden Daoists are virtuous, and it is their mission to redeem and remake the history of humankind. They are compelled to manifest destiny.

You are expected to uphold our decorum, speak kindly of the DAO to others, and spread good vibes.

****

**WE TAKE THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT**

1. The Great Carbon Rush of the 21st Century is already underway. Permanent atmospheric carbon removals are scarce and immensely valuable because they literally cool the planet.
2. Carbon removal is to the 21st Century as Gold has been to history. Your competition? Multinational corporations ($), hedge funds (\$$), and nation-states (\$$$).
3. DAOs coordinate capital at global scales. ConstitutionDAO raised $47M in 1 week to buy a historical artifact.

**THEREFORE THE EDEN DAOISTS EMBARK ON THE JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME TO**

1. Accumulate the planetâ€™s largest stockpile of the scarce, high-quality, long-term carbon removals.
2. Coordinate $50M with **** [drm-dao.md](../drm-dao.md "mention") to change the history of the world and set ourselves up on a course of planetary regeneration.
3. Bootstrap our decarbonization warp drive [eden-dao-protocol](../eden-dao-protocol/ "mention") with the worldâ€™s best reserve of carbon to hyperscale planetary regeneration.
