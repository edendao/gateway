## The Map of our Garden

### **(1, 1) Corporations can use EDN to buy and redeem offsets**

EDN can be purchased for $1 each and exchanged for CDRM tokens in the EDN / CDRM UniV3 pool. CDRM tokens represent tons of CO2, like BCT. These can be redeemed through a proposal submitted to the EDEN DAO for the underlying Toucan TCO2 offset.

### (2, 2) Forge EDN into sEDN

EDN can be forged into sEDN by rebalancing and adding liquidity to the EDN / CDRM pool. This LP is tokenized into the sEDN ERC20. The LP is owned by the DAO on behalf of sEDN holders.

### (3, 3) **Plant sEDN to mint gEDN**

sEDN can be planted in the Garden for gEDN. gEDN receives sEDN rewards when the planet gets healed.

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Watch your sEDN grow as the planet heals

When CDRM tokens are forged into sEDN, new EDN is created and distributed to gEDN holders as harvestable sEDN.

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Harvest sEDN into stables&#x20;

Once planted, sEDN cannot be unplanted. Better, it can be harvested into stablecoins. This will proliferate clean money across the entire financial system.

Initially, this may require a debt market like Fuse Pools. Our vision is to have sEDN — a new store of value — directly serve as collateral for stablecoins. This could be for minting the Celo Dollar, Fei, or other stablecoins.



## Token Guide

### EDN and CDRM: A source of value for the 21st century

Carbon offset tokens measure CO2 mass in tonnes. This is a perfectly adequate unit of measure for what it was invented for: Reducing emissions.

Recently humanity has been bootstrapping its ability to transform carbon into stable forms. These can be tokenized as carbon alchemy tokens. Carbon alchemy is tokenized as the CDRM token, measuring mass like BCT. **We tokenize the value of the mass — measured in tonnes of CO2 — into CDRM tokens.**

In carbon rewards they call they have a quantifiable (yet currently non-financially-instrumented) axis called "permanence" or "durability". This is how many years the carbon is stable in its form.&#x20;

We view this stability as cause for celebration. For example, carbon turned into rocks gives 1,000 years of credit — 1,000 EDN — because it is permanently stored. Carbon captured by trees gives credit as long as the lease on the land, and then need to get re-accredited.&#x20;

We source our permanence values from the industry's best: [(carbon)plan](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database). And we reward it. When new CDRM is deposited into the protocol, new EDN is minted equal to the sum of the underlying years of permanence. **We tokenize the value of time — measured in years of reward — into EDN tokens.**

### sEDN: a store of value for the 21st century

**sEDN holders LP the world's best store of value for the world's best carbon assets.**

The majority of CDRM and EDN live in the EDN / CDRM LP pool, which is tokenized into sEDN. sEDN is a store of value measuring `tCO2•years`, which serves as our elegant foundation to disrupting the carbon markets. Pools preserve and increase in value `k = x•y` over time. Given `x = CDRM = tCO2` and `y = EDN = years`, the unit of value is `k = x•y = CDRM•EDN = tCO2•years`. This value is fractionalized into sEDN.
