## The Map of our Garden

### EDN and CDRM: A source of value for the 21st century

Carbon offset tokens measure CO2 mass in tonnes. This is a perfectly adequate unit of measure for what it was invented for: Reducing emissions.

Recently humanity has been bootstrapping its ability to transform carbon into stable forms. These can be tokenized as carbon alchemy tokens. Carbon alchemy is tokenized as the CDRM token, measuring mass like BCT. **We tokenize the value of the mass — measured in tonnes of CO2 — into CDRM tokens.**

In carbon rewards they call they have a quantifiable (yet currently non-financially-instrumented) axis called "permanence" or "durability". This is how many years the carbon is stable in its form.&#x20;

We view this stability as cause for celebration. For example, carbon turned into rocks gives 1,000 years of credit — 1,000 EDN — because it is permanently stored. Carbon captured by trees gives credit as long as the lease on the land, and then need to get re-accredited.&#x20;

We source our permanence values from the industry's best: [(carbon)plan](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database). And we reward it. When new CDRM is deposited into the protocol, new EDN is minted equal to the sum of the underlying years of permanence. **We tokenize the value of time — measured in years of reward — into EDN tokens.**

### **(1, 1) Corporations can use EDN to buy and redeem offsets**

EDN can be purchased for $1 each and exchanged for CDRM tokens with the EDN / CDRM LP. CDRM tokens represent tons of CO2, like BCT. These can be redeemed through a proposal submitted to the EDEN DAO for the underlying Toucan TCO2 offset.

### (2, 2) DeFi users can LP EDN / CDRM to increase cost of compliance

DeFi users can purchase EDN and LP the EDN / CDRM pool to receive an LP token.

### (3, 3) **DeFi users bond LP to mint gEDN**

By default, DeFi users will automatically plant their LP for gEDN. gEDN receives yield (targeting 20% APY) and has governance powers in the DAO. gEDN is like a permanent treasury bond — you remove your EDN from circulating supply in exchange for yield.

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Watch your stack grow as the planet heals

When carbon is deposited into the protocol, the increase in protocol owned liquidity is twice the number of EDN tokens minted. Half this value is distributed to the DAO, the protocol, and gEDN holders to power the 20% target APY (or increase runway).

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Harvest EDN into stables&#x20;

The protocol, on your behalf, can use the EDN underlying your gEDN token to mint an existing stablecoin, like FEI, CUSD, etc. through a debt market. Your yield goes towards repaying your debt.
