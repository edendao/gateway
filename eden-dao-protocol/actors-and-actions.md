# ♟ Actors & Actions

Eden Dao examines the outcomes of actions taken part of the two types of actors in the protocol.

1. The first type of actor we call **Eden Daoists.** They **are crypto climate capitalists**. They are like the [_Klimate_ of KlimaDAO.](https://docs.klimadao.finance/tokenomics-and-mechanisms/game-theory-olympus-inspired) They **seek DeFi yield and stability.**
2. The second type of actor we call **Eden Daoists.** They **are carbon chain bridgers.** In Klima, these are the BCT bridgers who bond for Klima at RFV. They **seek a premium over off-chain prices.**

**Plant**ing turns your sEDN into gEDN, the governance and yield token. As new carbon is bonded into the protocol, yield is distributed to gEDN token holders.

**Bond**ing turns your EDN currency (to pay for CDRM) into the sEDN carbon store of value (in ton•years). It frees up the deposited capital to be invested in the healing of our planet and the generation of additional yield.&#x20;

**Redeem**ing your EDN uses the bonding contract for zero slippage and no price movement. This leaves the other market participants unaffected by your decision to redeem.
