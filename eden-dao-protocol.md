A token flow diagram! For those systematically inclined.

### In the beginning there was EDN

1 EDN can be minted by depositing $1 USD worth of stablecoins.

**The (1, 1) strategy:** EDN can be used to purchase CDRM tokens in the EDN / CDRM Uniswap V3 pool. CDRM tokens represent tons of CO2, like BCT. These can be redeemed through a proposal submitted to the EDEN DAO for the underlying Toucan TCO2 offset.

****

### **Bond with the planetary reserves**

**The (2, 2) strategy:** EDN can be used to rebalance and add liquidity to the EDN / CDRM pool. This is irreversible. The LP is tokenized into the sEDN ERC20.

sEDN tokenizes tCO2eâ€¢years, a disruptive new commodity for the carbon _removal_ market.

### **Plant the seeds of regeneration**

**The (3, 3) strategy:** sEDN can be planted in the Garden for gEDN. gEDN has compounding sEDN rewards.

gEDN is an index of sEDN, and receives newly minted sEDN when additional carbon is bonded to the reserves.



### Enjoy the infinite harvest&#x20;

sEDN can be harvested into stablecoins.

Initially, this may require a debt market like Fuse Pools.

Our vision is to have sEDN â€” a new store of value â€” directly serve as collateral for stablecoins. This could be for minting the Celo Dollar, Fei, or other stablecoins.



### Grow the planet's carbon reserve

When qualified projects may bond new (CDRM) Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass to our EDN / CDRM pool, the Eden Protocol mints EDN to represent the total number of years of storage from deposited CDRM at `Xâ€¢Y EDN = X CDRM â€¢Â Y years / CDRM.`
