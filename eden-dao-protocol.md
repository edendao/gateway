# ðŸŒŸ Eden Dao Protocol

> Like other DAOs, we spent a lot of time weighing the tradeoffs of different chains. As a long-term thinker, I felt dissatisfied with being locked in on a single chain. This caused its fair share of deliberation, which no doubt other DAOs are familiar with.&#x20;
>
> We can't onboard the next billion users in crypto if we each spend months deciding where to launch on. On-chain data is fragmented. Users can't carry their data with them across chains.&#x20;
>
> And we were met with a similar fate, that is, until we discovered LayerZero. LayerZero lets you build cross-chain apps that communicate through an oracle and relayer to bridge messages across chains. The possibilities are endless.
>
> This protocol came to me in the form of inspiration, on a red eye to Barcelona for Celo Connect. It is a culmination of a yearlong journey through the idea maze to create an inflection point in humanity's climate journey.&#x20;
>
> I barely slept that flight, moved to prototype the set of contracts that became this protocol. I've been riding that wave to present to you this protocol, for the public good.
>
> As DAO natives, let us liberate ourselves from the shackles of a chain to move at 100x the speed in the omnispace world. We can now sign up for whatever DAO tooling that works, without deliberating for months on chain lock-in.&#x20;

> As is often the case in crypto, we needed infrastructure that hadn't been built yet. So I built it.

Eden Dao Protocol is an ecosystem designed to harmonize value and identity across the _omnispace_ â€” the space on, between, and around the chains. It operates as public goods infrastructure. Our ecosystem is designed to empower users, DAOs, and protocols with powers never seen before, and we're excited to see how people build on them.&#x20;

1. **Passport** lets users take their on-chain identity throughout omnispace
2. **Channel** allows users and developers you to read and write data in the omnispace
3. **Note** is an omnichain store-of-value with fast, no-slippage bridging thanks to LayerZero.

Launching on Ethereum, and then Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Celo, soon after.

### Eden Dao **Passport** is your omnichain identity

**Passport** unlocks a fascinating new frontier. Soulbound to a user's wallet address, they can serve as a user's canonical omnichain identity. Users can carry their on-chain PFP across omnispace.  Builders can use Passport Channels to write on-chain user identity across omnispace.

### Eden Dao **Channel is your space** on the omnichain

**Channel** are like omnichain radio channels for builders and artists. Holding a Channel NFT lets users and smart contracts send data to any passport, on any chain, by writing to a dedicated `bytes` storage slot on every **Passport**.

### Eden Dao **Note** is the omnichain store of value

Omnispace overflows beyond blockchains and into our world. For but a brief moment, we ask that you take a moment to tune into the energy of our world, feel its pain, and suffering as we watch derailed natural cycles plunging us towards biosphere collapse.

What is supremely valuable is our civilization's continued dignified flourishing in the world. We infuse our optimism for the future in the EDN token. EDN unlocks a new frontier because it is simple and slippage-free to bridge across chains.&#x20;

We've got a lot in store for EDN in the future â€”Â this is only the beginning. We're really excited to see what people build with this. Reach out and we'll see if we can help you!&#x20;

#### Note for the Public Good

As you interact with our protocol, you will have many opportunities to call `payable` contracts. For every ETH you gift, these contracts will honor you with 1,000 EDN tokens.

Omnispace overflows beyond blockchains and into our world. For but a brief moment, we ask that you take a moment to tune into the energy of our world, feel its pain, and suffering as we watch derailed natural cycles plunging us towards biosphere collapse.

What is supremely valuable is our civilization's continued dignified flourishing in the world. We infuse our optimism for the future in the EDN token. Take these tokens of gratitude for your donation. In collaboration with Endaoment.org, we will run a tax-deductible, non-profit program to use all proceeds towards matching quadratic funding pool for the Wagyu A5 beef of carbon credits, also known as permanent carbon dioxide removal. We will run this in collaboration with Gitcoin. All proceeds until July 1st, 2022 will be a part of this program.

We have to make it absolutely clear that by making a contribution to the Eden Dao through its payable contract methods ON CONTRACTS X, Y, and Z, you, the Contributor, donate Ethereum tokens (ETH) in order to receive EDN tokens solely for the Contributorâ€™s own benefit and account, for the purposes of personal consumption and utilization of EDN tokens on the many chains and not for any speculative purpose or with an expectation of profit, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a public offering or other distribution of EDN tokens, whether in exchange for other any other digital asset, any currency, any security or otherwise, and all of the foregoing remains true, accurate and complete on and as of the date of the contribution.
