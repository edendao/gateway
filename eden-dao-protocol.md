## The Map of our Garden

### Find EDN at the Temple Gates

1 EDN can be minted anytime by depositing $1 USD worth of stablecoins.

### **(1, 1) Offsetters can use EDN to buy and redeem offsets**

EDN can be used to purchase CDRM tokens in the EDN / CDRM UniV3 pool. CDRM tokens represent tons of CO2, like BCT. These can be redeemed through a proposal submitted to the EDEN DAO for the underlying Toucan TCO2 offset.

### **(2, 2) DeFi Wizards use EDN to LP the EDN / CDRM UniV3 Pool**

EDN can be used to rebalance and add liquidity to the EDN / CDRM pool. The LP is tokenized into the sEDN ERC20. sEDN is backed by but not redeemable for EDN and CDRM.

### (3, 3) **Plant the seeds of regeneration**

sEDN can be planted in the Garden for gEDN. gEDN receives sEDN rewards when additional carbon is bonded to the reserves.

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Earn sEDN as the planet gets healed

Qualified projects may bond (CDRM) Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass to the protocol new sEDN is minted and distributed to gEDN token holders.

### (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) Harvest sEDN into stables&#x20;

sEDN rewards can be harvested into stablecoins. Initially, this may require a debt market like Fuse Pools. Our vision is to have sEDN — a new store of value — directly serve as collateral for stablecoins. This could be for minting the Celo Dollar, Fei, or other stablecoins.



## Token Guide

### EDN and CDRM: A source of value for the 21st century

Carbon offset tokens measure CO2 mass in tonnes. This is a perfectly adequate unit of measure for what it was invented for: Reducing emissions.

Recently humanity has been bootstrapping its ability to transform carbon into stable forms. These can be tokenized as carbon alchemy tokens. Carbon alchemy is tokenized as the CDRM token, measuring mass like BCT. **We tokenize the value of the mass — measured in tonnes of CO2 — into CDRM tokens.**

In carbon markets they call they have something called "permanence" or "durability". We call it "credit". We source our credit measurement from the industry's best: [(carbon)plan](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-database). Using this we can rate the `years of credit` for an amount of a carbon alchemy token. **We tokenize the value of time — measured in years of credit — into EDN tokens.**

For example, carbon turned into rocks gives 1,000 years of credit — 1,000 EDN — because it is permanently stored. Carbon captured by trees gives credit as long as the lease on the land, and then need to get re-accredited. As long as the trees are preserved they can continue to get reaccredited to produce additional EDN token.

### sEDN: a store of value for the 21st century

**sEDN holders LP the world's best store of value for the world's best carbon assets.**

The majority of CDRM and EDN live in the EDN / CDRM LP pool, which is tokenized into sEDN. sEDN is a store of value measuring `tCO2•years`, which serves as our elegant foundation to disrupting the carbon markets. Pools preserve and increase in value `k = x•y` over time. Given `x = CDRM = tCO2` and `y = EDN = years`, the unit of value is `k = x•y = CDRM•EDN = tCO2•years`. This value is fractionalized into sEDN.
