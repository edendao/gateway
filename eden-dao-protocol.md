# ðŸŒŸ Eden Dao Protocol

Omnispace overflows beyond blockchains and into our world. For but a brief moment, we ask that you take a moment to tune into the energy of our world, feel its suffering as we watch derailed natural cycles plunging us towards biosphere collapse.

Now imagine future Planet Eden, one where humanity lives harmoniously its natural cycles. Eden Dao is our journey from Planet Earth to Planet Eden. We find the highest-leverage opportunities then we find the _wei_ to make it happen. This protocol is designed to **** bootstrap the regenerative economy.

Eden Dao Protocol is infrastructure that accelerates the public good. It is a protocol ecosystem designed to harmonize value and identity across the _omnispace_ â€” the space on, between, and around the chains. Our ecosystem is designed to empower users, DAOs, and protocols the power to travel through omnispace. We're excited to see how people build on our foundation.

1. **Passport** is soulbound on-chain omnichain identity
2. **Channel** allows users and builders to read and write data on **Passport** across omnispace
3. **Note** is a token symbolizing our optimism for the future, an omnichain token with fast, no-slippage bridging.

Launching on Ethereum, and then Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Celo, soon after. Built with LayerZero.

### **1. Passport** is your omnichain identity

**Passport** unlocks a fascinating new frontier. Soulbound to a user's wallet address, they can serve as a user's canonical omnichain identity. Users can carry their on-chain PFP across omnispace.  Builders can use Passport Channels to write on-chain user identity across omnispace.

### **2. Channel is your space** on the omnichain

**Channel** are like omnichain radio channels for builders and artists. Holding a Channel NFT lets users and smart contracts send data to any passport, on any chain, by writing to a dedicated `bytes` storage slot on every **Passport**.

### **3. Note** is a disruptive omnichain token

> This ecosystem reflects the _notes_ of our _metta_ â€”Â loving kindness â€” into the space and time.&#x20;
>
> May our _notes_, together, harmonize into a symphony.

Note unlocks a new frontier because of its simple and slippage-free ability to bridge across chains. We've got a lot in store for Note â€”Â this is only the beginning.

A picture is worth a thousand words, a future harmonious with our natural cycles is priceless. A picture is worth a thousand words, an ETH is worth a thousand _Note_. As you interact with our protocol, you will have many opportunities to call `payable` contracts. We _Note_ your gift of ETH.

We infuse our optimism for the future in the EDN token. It can mean anything we imagine it to mean. **Imagine EDN as planting a tree so that future generations can have shade!** Let it remind you to [never give up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd\_iWuE)! Let the climate nerds of _Eden Dao_ imagine that it symbolizes CO2 removed over time.

We have to make it absolutely clear that by making a contribution to the Eden Dao through its payable contract methods ON CONTRACTS X, Y, and Z, you, the Contributor, donate Ethereum tokens (ETH) in order to receive EDN tokens solely for the Contributorâ€™s own benefit and account, for the purposes of personal consumption and utilization of EDN tokens on the many chains and not for any speculative purpose or with an expectation of profit, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a public offering or other distribution of EDN tokens, whether in exchange for other any other digital asset, any currency, any security or otherwise, and all of the foregoing remains true, accurate and complete on and as of the date of the contribution.
