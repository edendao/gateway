# ðŸŒŸ Eden Dao Protocol

> Like other DAOs, we spent a lot of time weighing the tradeoffs of different chains. As a long-term thinker, I felt dissatisfied with being locked in on a single chain. This caused its fair share of deliberation, which no doubt other DAOs are familiar with.&#x20;
>
> We can't onboard the next billion users in crypto if we each spend months deciding where to launch on. On-chain data is fragmented. Users can't carry their data with them across chains.&#x20;
>
> And we were met with a similar fate, that is, until we discovered LayerZero. LayerZero lets you build cross-chain apps that communicate through an oracle and relayer to bridge messages across chains. The possibilities are endless.

> This protocol came to me in the form of inspiration, on a red eye to Barcelona for Celo Connect. It is a culmination of a yearlong journey through the idea maze to create an inflection point in humanity's climate journey.&#x20;
>
> I barely slept that flight, moved to prototype the set of contracts that became this protocol. I've been riding that wave to present to you this protocol, for the public good.
>
> As DAO natives, let us liberate ourselves from the shackles of a chain to move at 100x the speed in an omnichain world. We can now sign up for whatever DAO tooling that works, without deliberating for months on chain lock-in.&#x20;

> As is often the case in crypto, we needed infrastructure that hadn't been built yet. So I built it.

Eden Dao Protocol is an ecosystem of protocols designed to harmonize value and identity across the omnispace â€” the space on, between, and around the chains. They empower users, DAOs, and protocols with powers never seen before, and we're excited to see how people build on them. And they also water the gardens of our Garden of Eden â€”Â Planet Earth â€” so that a regenerative renaissance may blossom.

1. **Passport** is an omnichain identity protocol built around a synchronizable, soulbound NFT
2. **Domain** protocol allows NFT holders to permissionlessly and securely write and sync _Passport_ data across omnispace.
3. **Note** is an omnichain synthetic ERC20 with fast, no-slippage bridging thanks to LayerZero.

Launching on Ethereum, and then Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Celo, soon after.

### Eden Dao **Passport** is omnichain identity public goods infrastructure for DAOs and protocols.

This unlocks a fascinating new frontier. Users can carry their PFP with themselves across the chains. Builders can use Passport to sync user identity directly on-chain to let you carry your skills and credentials with you. Nifty social artists can reserve a spot on every passport to "stamp" with a tokenURI.

### Eden Dao **Domain** is your omnispace airwave

To write to **Passport**, you need a **Domain** NFT. These are your airwaves â€” Radio Stations may have 98.4 FM â€” and Gitcoin has Domain 69420. Is your application on an L2, like Polygon, or Arbitrum? No worries, old friend. You can bridge that Domain over. Now you can write data to Passport on your app's L2.

You can mint your first Domain by sending at least 0.05 ETH to the ConjureDeus contract here: `0xADDY`. This will register the domain uniquely associated with your wallet address. For more control, head on over to Etherscan and call the `cast(uint256 domainId) payable` to mint a vanity domain ID. For a fair launch, every address may mint up to 5 domains.

### Eden Dao **Note** (EDN) is the omnichain token for the public good

EDN is the foundation for a new wave of omnichain value communication. DAOs can purchase EDN to compensate contributors across any chain quickly and with no slippage. EDN is like a Phoenix, it burns on the source chain to mint on the destination.

As you interact with our protocol, you will have many opportunities to call `payable` contracts. For every ETH you gift, these contracts will honor you with 1,000 EDN tokens.

We've got a lot in store for EDN in the future â€”Â this is only the beginning. We're really excited to see what people build with this. Reach out and we'll see if we can help you!&#x20;

### Note for the Public Good

The omnichain space overflows beyond blockchains and into our world. For but a brief moment, we ask that you take a moment to tune into the energy of our world, feel its pain, and suffering as we watch derailed natural cycles plunging us towards biosphere collapse.

What is supremely valuable is our civilization's continued dignified flourishing in the world. We infuse our optimism for the future in the EDN token. Take these tokens of gratitude for your donation. In collaboration with Endaoment.org, we will run a tax-deductible, non-profit program to use all proceeds towards matching quadratic funding pool for the Wagyu A5 beef of carbon credits, also known as permanent carbon dioxide removal. We will run this in collaboration with Gitcoin. All proceeds until July 1st, 2022 will be a part of this program.

We have to make it absolutely clear that by making a contribution to the Eden Dao through its payable contract methods, you, the Contributor, donate Ethereum tokens (ETH) in order to receive EDN tokens solely for the Contributorâ€™s own benefit and account, for the purposes of personal consumption and utilization of EDN tokens on the many chains and not for any speculative purpose or with an expectation of profit, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a public offering or other distribution of EDN tokens, whether in exchange for other any other digital asset, any currency, any security or otherwise, and all of the foregoing remains true, accurate and complete on and as of the date of the contribution.
