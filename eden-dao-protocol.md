# ðŸŒŸ Eden Dao Protocol

**Weâ€™re going to create the economic game we all should be playing and invite everyone to play it. In the process, we heal our Planet Earth.**

**We will establish a new store of value for the 21st century. A carbon currency that regenerates the planet. A currency that powers a cyber-physical digital-state. A currency that powers an economy that produces the gold of the 21st century.**

The Eden Dao Note (EDN) is a new carbon currency. It is minted through EDEN BONDS to reflect the value of the outer world. It is more like FEI than OHM or TEMPLE, minted to reflect value added to the protocol.

At mint, it is immediately bonded to gEDN. gEDN is the governance token for the Garden of EDN.

In our Garden we must build 4 Pillars to uphold our Temple.

## The Temple Pillars

### **1. EDEN FRAX BOND**

gEDN holders govern the exchange rate of FRAX and EDN, which will be initialized to `A â€¢ 1 FRAX = 1 EDN`. A will be initialized to 1 and is expected to grow over time. Forward guidance will be offered by GRDN DAO.



For DeFi users, the experience will be:

1. Approve $X FRAX
2. Bond $X FRAX, receive $X worth of gEDN.\
   Under the hood, this will:
   1. Mint `EDN at 1 EDN = max(bondRate = 1 FRAX, EDN / FRAX exchange rate)`
   2. Deposit EDN and FRAX for LP Bond the LP for gEDN (valued at $X \* 2)
   3. Transfer $X worth of gEDN each to the receiver and the TEMPLE RESERVES.

### **2. EDEN CDRM BOND**

When Carbon is removed from the atmosphere, it is bonded to our Earth. Over long periods of time, through natural processes, it is unbonded. For when a tree burns, the carbon is released back into the atmosphere. But mineralized carbon (the alchemy of turning CO2 into rocks) stores carbon for thousands of years.

Carbon projects all remove carbon, but they have different bonding rates for that carbon. Therefore, we need a unit to measure mass over time. `X EDN = 1 tCO2e â€¢ X years`.



For DeFi users, the experience will be:

1. Approve $X FRAX
2. Bond $X FRAX, receive $X worth of gEDN.\
   Under the hood, this will:
   1. Mint `EDN at 1 EDN = max(bondRate = 1 FRAX, EDN / FRAX exchange rate)`
   2. Deposit EDN and FRAX for LP Bond the LP for gEDN (valued at $X \* 2)
   3. Transfer $X worth of gEDN each to the receiver and the TEMPLE RESERVES.

### 3. gEDN / FRAX POOL

Over the time the TEMPLE RESERVES accrues gEDN from the entry of new market participants (Pillars 1 and 2), as well as trading fees from the LP pools. At the DAOâ€™s discretion, liquidity may be withdrawn from the EDN / FRAX market.

The EDN would be burned. The FRAX could then be paired with DAO-governed gEDN to bootstrap a gEDN / FRAX LP pool. But this is not where gEDN token holders get their liquidity. They get something way better.



### 4. EDEN INFINITE HARVEST

The gEDN / FRAX LP acts as a price oracle for gEDN to enable EDEN INFINITE HARVEST. EDEN INFINITE HARVEST is a gEDN-collateralized debt market where the LP yield on your gEDN pays your debt off with time.

For anyone, including project developers, this means that we can take out debt backed by gEDN. Better yet, this loan doesnâ€™t require repayment, because the yield on gEDN pays it back over time. Your gEDN will only grow with time, my friend, for this vault will replenish your cup for centuries.
