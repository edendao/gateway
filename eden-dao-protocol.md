**We’re going to create the economic game we all should be playing and invite everyone to play it. In the process, we heal our Planet Earth.**

### EDN is at the base of the mountain

1 EDN can be minted anytime by depositing $1 USD worth of stablecoins.

### **(1, 1) Offsetters use EDN to buy and redeem offsets**

EDN can be used to purchase CDRM tokens in the EDN / CDRM Uniswap V3 pool. CDRM tokens represent tons of CO2, like BCT. These can be redeemed through a proposal submitted to the EDEN DAO for the underlying Toucan TCO2 offset.

### **(2, 2) DeFi Wizards LP the EDN / CDRM pear**

EDN can be used to rebalance and add liquidity to the EDN / CDRM pool. This is irreversible. The LP is tokenized into the sEDN ERC20.



## (🌎, 🌍, 🌏) **Plant the seeds of regeneration**

sEDN can be planted in the Garden for gEDN. gEDN has compounding sEDN rewards. **** gEDN is an index of sEDN, and receives sEDN rewards when additional carbon is bonded to the reserves.

#### Earn sEDN as the planet gets healed

When qualified projects may bond new (CDRM) Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass to our EDN / CDRM pool, there is new sEDN minted and distributed to gEDN token holders.

#### Harvest sEDN into stables&#x20;

sEDN rewards can be harvested into stablecoins. Initially, this may require a debt market like Fuse Pools. Our vision is to have sEDN — a new store of value — directly serve as collateral for stablecoins. This could be for minting the Celo Dollar, Fei, or other stablecoins.

#### sEDN as a store of value for the 21st century

sEDN is a store of value measuring `tCO2•years`. It is the natural evolution of "carbon offsets" intentionally designed for the carbon removal market. This is because the true commodity underlying _the carbon removal market is_ `tCO2e•years`.

The EDN / CDRM pool is a store of value that preserves a stable and increasing value over time. Philosophically, `k = x•y = tCO2•years`, where:

1. `x = CDRM`, Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass, measuring _tonnes of CO2_ `tCO2`.
2. `y = EDN`, Eden Dao Note, measuring _years of permanence_ `years`.
