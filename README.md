Welcome, dear friend, make yourself at home.

We are at a turning point in history.

You have found our path towards harmony with the natural order of our sacred planet.

Our dream is to be proud of the planet we leave for future generations.

The Eden Dao is our collective story of rising to meetâ€¨ the challenge of this moment.

It will require the aid of unheralded heroes hidden deep within companies, value chains, government departments â€”Â all throughout the world.

And it will need you.

**So that together we may say that â€” against all odds â€” **_**we unfucked the planet.**_

To do this we must question our learned mental models of what is valuable, and what isn't. Throughout history, people, empires and nations have sought gold and more recently oil, and they have murdered, warred and destroyed to get them. But why is gold, a shiny metal with few industrial uses, valuable? Oil is obviously useful, but how can we value it when it's use is destroying our planet? We should value what matters. For this next phase of history, we must make saving our planet the most valuable thing.

We must reduce emissions â€” and we have â€” demand for carbon offsets has exploded over the past 3 years and now outpaces annual supply growth. But we need to be doing more. Weâ€™ve got to give it all that weâ€™ve got.

And not only do we have to massively reduce the 40 billion tonnes of CO2 we emit every year, but we will also have to capture all those and historical emissions if we want to unfuck the planet.

This will require global human carbon removal ability to be 50â€“100 billion tonnes a year.

We canâ€™t even muster 40 million.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

To unfuck the planet, the road is long ahead.

What we need is a new market that directs funding to where it is needed â€” the pioneering companies and project developers who are our best shot at scaling carbon removal to clean up the mess we've been complicit in making.

Our dreams of harmony with the carbon cycle of our planet are in the future hands of these heroes. We can direct liquidity to them by buying their future carbon removals.

We want to help projects go from 0â€“1, then help them scale from 1 to 100. Future carbon removals lets us proactively fund the methodologies that can unfuck the planet.

This is similar to Stripe Climate, or Shopify's Sustainability Fund. Stripe, for example, leads the industry with $250K purchases of future carbon removals to be delivered in 2 years. They are inspirations for this endeavour, and without their public goods, this project would never have existed. How might crypto capitalists create a decentralized Stripe Climate?

As climate capitalists, we believe that markets direct capital to where it is needed. Which is why we're creating a way for carbon removal projects to get paid for manifesting our dreams of the future. In this market we buy future carbon removal mass. We buy our dreams of removing mass from the atmosphere.

We want to kick-start the DeFi market for future carbon â€” and invite everyone to join us in this journey.

Welcome to the Dao.
