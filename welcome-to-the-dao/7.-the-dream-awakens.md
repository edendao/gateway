# ðŸŒ… 7. The Dream Awakens

Near the foundation of our being, there is the breath.

> You are not in charge of your breathing, or at least, not so much.
>
> Yes, you could hold your breath (for a while) and you could choose to breathe deliberately fast and shallow for a time, but fairly soon any attempt to force the breath will produce counter-measures from within.
>
> At the same time, with practice, itâ€™s possible to learn to align with the breath, gently moving with it, while [allowing space](https://www.mindful.org/learning-the-light-touch-of-allowing/) for it to come into its own natural depth, pace, and flow.
>
> Things seem to go best when we cooperate with the breath, rather than resisting or clinging to it.[ â†—](https://www.mindful.org/6-reasons-why-mindfulness-begins-with-the-breath/)

Each dream is a unique sensory experience, and no two are alike. They present new perspectives on harmonizing with the nature of reality.
