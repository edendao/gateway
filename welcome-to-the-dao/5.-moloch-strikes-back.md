> Simply put, the rate of capital flow into climate tech commercialization is nowhere near enough for the exponential scaling we need to save the planet.\
> _â€”Â Jim, Founder @ The Future Forest Company_

The solutions we need are coming online, but they are unable to scale at the breakneck pace required to reach 1.5Âº. One of the principal bottlenecks to this is the insufficient capital flow into carbon removal and reduction technologies at the commercialization stage.&#x20;

### TradFi is dropping the ball

The capital requirements for commercializing these technologies tend to be beyond the risk tolerance and timelines of most debt and equity market participants ([2016, Page 9](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65374.pdf)). Hence, carbon tech companies have trouble getting the fast cash they need to scale exponentially.&#x20;
