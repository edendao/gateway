# 🌌 4. A New Hope

Let’s start with some good news: there is growing social momentum to implement exponential climate technology.

Investment in climate tech projects [has reached all time highs this year](https://dealroom.co/blog/climate-tech-investment-trends) spanning climate adaptation, decarbonization and electrification, as well as carbon removal and sequestration.

While the [ill-fated clean tech movement of the past decade](https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff\_solyndra/) has perhaps not met expectations of investors and policymakers alike, the [climate tech industry is ambitiously pursuing new innovation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/31/will-this-generation-of-climate-tech-be-different/) with accessible capital, and there is [significant interest from younger generations](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/06/gen-z-climate-change-careers-jobs).

There is a range of technologies and projects that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Increasingly, these include a ‘frontier’ of high-tech solutions in addition to methodologies that have existed for decades, such as reforestation. What do some examples look like?&#x20;

* 🐋 [Climeworks’](https://climeworks.com) new geothermal energy-powered [‘Orca’ plant](https://climeworks.com/roadmap/orca) in Iceland removes carbon from the air via a system of collector units that chemically bind carbon to filters.
* 🪨 [44.01](https://4401.earth) harnesses the natural process by which [peridotite](https://www.britannica.com/science/peridotite#:\~:text=peridotite%2C%20a%20coarse%2Dgrained%2C,more%20than%2010%20percent%20feldspar.) absorbs & sequesters carbon.
* 🪨 [Heirloom](https://www.heirloomcarbon.com) uses natural forming minerals as scalable carbon sinks (much like 44.01 above).
* 🌧️ [The Future Forest Company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com) is attempting to scale the process by which CO2 in rainwater reacts with rocks and turns into carbonate (known as "rock weathering").&#x20;
* 🌊 [Running Tide](https://www.runningtide.com) accelerates photosynthesis in kelp & then sinks it to the bottom of the ocean.
* 🌱 [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com) turns plants and biomass into an oil-like liquid which is then pumped underground.
* 🌿 [Carbo Culture](https://carboculture.com) accelerates the process by which biomass turns into biocarbons via pyrolysis.



**Decarbonization** requires reducing CO2 emissions and removing CO2 from the atmosphere. To do this, we need to fund the right types of climate solutions. There are a variety of vectors here, examples of which include:&#x20;

1. **Renewable Energy:** Creating fossil fuel alternatives that cause less pollution and that we can create more of.
2. **Ocean:** Maximizing the world's largest carbon sink and reducing ocean acidification.
3. **Mineralization:** Turning carbon into a mineral that can be stored long term.
4. **Soil:** Using specific farming techniques that increase soil health and soil carbon.
5. **Forest:** Planting, restoring, and protecting forests to allow trees to store more carbon.
6. **Transportation:** Reducing and offsetting emissions caused by transport vehicles.
7. **Product:** Injecting and storing carbon directly into usable products, like concrete.
8. **Direct Air Capture:** Pulling carbon directly out of the air, then it storing it safely and long term.
9. **Biomass:** Using organic material to create renewable energy and store carbon in creative ways.



Among all the options, carbon removal methodologies are the wildcard that could unlock almost infinitely scalable de-carbonization.
