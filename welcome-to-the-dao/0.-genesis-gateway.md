In the Book of Genesis, the location of the Garden was described as the lake that birthed four streams of water ([Genesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Genesis) 2-3 and [Ezekiel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Ezekiel) 28, 31).

Eden is not only a _place_, however, but also a state of _mind_. It the _Dao_ of Daoism. Abrahamic faiths and Eastern spirituality are both fingers pointing at the same moon.

This is what we mean by _The Eden Dao._



This state of mind is accessible by anyone — "Buddha-nature".

Acting out of True Nature, you find that there is something greater supporting you.

You experience the world through open-hearted awareness. You find that you are flowing with a natural, loving-kindness that comes from a sense of ease and well-being.&#x20;

True Nature is the _Eden Dao._

It was by inhabiting this headspace that Cyrus dreamed of the Eden Dao. The Dao of Eden is a manifesto for a decarbonization warp drive to realign humanity with our carbon cycle while transferring wealth from global corporations to the people of Planet Earth
