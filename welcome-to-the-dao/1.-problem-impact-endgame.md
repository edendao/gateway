We intend to solve the critical **problems of the carbon markets:**&#x20;

1. Carbon credits are not a commodity, because every project has different Sustainable Development Goals
   * There is no price and volume transparency
   * There are no future price signals
2. It's hard to finance new carbon projects
   * It can take years to get revenue for credits as certification of credits can take years
   * Lack of future P\&L makes it a risky investment
3. The carbon economy is driven by external incentives
   * Driven by ESG, taxonomy, regulations, marketing and corporate responsibility
   * Current motivation incentivises the purchase of cheap low-quality credits

We'll do this by creating a voluntary carbon bonding market so that social capital can directly finance frontier carbon removal. The level of corporate commitments (BLUE) is nowhere near enough to get to 1.5Âº (RED).

Pushing the frontier of carbon removal means financing project developers to create new carbon removal projects. This scales humanity's ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

For project developers, The Eden Dao empowers them to unlock the future liquidity of their existing projects to finance the development of _new projects_. We are building a DeFi marketplace to raise all ships.&#x20;

**The Temple Treasury accumulates massive amounts of future carbon mass.** It will mint a currency, EDN, backed by this reserve.

Over time, our Treasury accumulates actual carbon mass. EDN can be used by global institutions to purchase non-transferrable offset credits that are backed by our carbon mass.

This is how we can the global institutions for high quality carbon removals â€” then sell it back to them. This is how we create a flow of wealth transfer from corporations to the people.



To contextualize this decarbonization warp drive, let's take a look at carbon markets.&#x20;
