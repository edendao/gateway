### **Carbon Pooling vs. Distributed Protocol Owned Liquidity**

Carbon offsets can cost anywhere from US$0.60 to US$2,000. BCT squeezes this to a single price. More carbon pools will create new markets, but still squeeze carbon prices into tranches.

_The Eden Dao_ meets carbon project developers where they're at to compensate them with a fair price for their carbon. Each project has its own price for carbon. This enables a wider variety of projects to flourish.

**Result: Better price discovery for projects and greater exposure to carbon market pricing.**

### **OlympusDAO vs. Custom Mechanics**

Klima is based off OlympusDAO whereas Eden Dao is will use custom tokenomics.

**Result: Stable price but lower potential APY, intrinsic value that is skewed towards rising.**
