I appreciate Stripe Climate and Shopify's Sustainability Fund. Without your public goods, this would not have been possible.

Jim from The Future Forest Company for activating my conviction in this idea.

Arjun for his eye for design, and the source of the "Eden" in the name.

Julia Lipton and Ryan Junee for believing in me.

Joshua Wilkinson for spotting me.

Maddie Hall for inspiring me.

Wojciech Zaremba for seeing my potential.

Dhrumil, who exemplified what it means to map a field.

Sanjna, with whom I learned how to listen.

And my parents for that which cannot be put into words.
