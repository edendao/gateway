# üèõ The Temple

**STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS**



In our Garden we will build our Temple to safeguard our wealth. Our Temple is inspired by [TempleDAO](https://templedao.medium.com/temple-introducing-our-guiding-principles-5fe566101f91), [OlympusDAO](https://docs.olympusdao.finance), and Rari Capital.

**The Temple of EDEN goes beyond yield-generating staking platforms to become a multi-faceted DeFi investment platform aimed at long-term wealth creation.**

### Temple Reserves

The Temple Reserves are responsible for managing the supply of the Eden Dao Note (EDN). EDN invests in the future price of carbon. EDN _is a currency_ that is backed by the Temple Reserve.&#x20;

There is the _Carbon Planetary Reserve_, which stores CDRM (Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass), and the _Crypto Reserve_, which stores crypto-assets.

EDN _as a currency_ can be redeemed at intrinsic value for carbon offsets from the Temple. When EDN trades below intrinsic value, global offsetters can purchase EDN at market price to redeem it at intrinsic value in our Carbon Planetary Reserve.&#x20;

EDN can be devoted to the Temple in exchange for EDEN, which receives rewards from the harvest. EDEN holders get to participate in Protocol Governance, which sets parameters for the protocol.&#x20;



### Carbon Harvest

The value of the Reserve's Carbon will often increase in value due to the [2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md](../the-potential/2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md "mention") or the minting of new EDN. In these times, the increase in reserve value will trigger the _Harvest_, which will mint and distribute new EDN backed by this additional reserve to EDEN bonders.&#x20;

* 49% is distributed to the staking pool.
* 27.5% goes to the Protocol Fund, governed by EDEN holders, which can be used for Liquidity Mining, Price Stabilizing, or as an Insurance Pool.
* 2.5% is never minted and therefore goes towards growing Intrinsic Value (IV) for token holders.
* 1% goes to the DRM Foundation to fund community projects
* 20% goes to the GRDN of Eden for their stewardship.



### Generational Wealth Transfer

The Temple will establish a Market for the purchase of carbon offsets by entities like DAOs, multinational corporations, or nation-state governments. They may redeem EDN at reserve value for carbon offsets which are backed by our CDRM. The purchase of offsets from the Carbon Reserve will retire the underlying CDRM tokens, and issue a non-transferrable, fungible, carbon offset token.



### Natural Capital Reserve Asset

Historically, nation-state currencies have shaped our physical world. These started out backed by gold. Gold was the reserve asset for global currencies.

In recent history, USD has been the global reserve asset. And it's time to move beyond a currency backed by the military industrial complex and the oil industry.

A truly _global_ currency ought to be decentralized and benefit the people of the whole world, not those of a particular nation-state. Using future carbon as a reserve asset can serve to kick-start a 21st century reserve currency that unfucks the planet.
