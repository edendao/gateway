# â˜¯ Eden Daoists

Eden Daoists practice our DeFi meditations to accelerate the decarbonization warp drive. They profit off the appreciation of the voluntary carbon offsets ([2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md](../welcome-to-the-dao/2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md "mention")).&#x20;

### Dao de DRM

_AKA Carbon Curation Markets_

> The Dao de DRM manifests destiny: The Great Carbon Rush of the 21st Century\
> Future Carbon = 21st Century Gold => Let's Accumulate High Quality Carbon

This active strategy where you learn to manifest your DRMs of an unfucked planet into EDN at the Bond Price (BP).

$$
IV < BP < MP
$$

We're DRMing of different meditations to curate carbon markets like:

1. _Ascending DRMs (Mirror.xyz-style WRITE RACE)_\
   Vote on project proposals with your DRM to see which rises to the top! The GRDN will prioritize the qualification of projects based on a qualitative assessment by the Carbon Council.
2. _Garden DRMs (1Hive Gardens Conviction Voting)_\
   __Fluidly reposition your DRM across projects to signal your preferences.
3. _Angel Rounds (Quadratic Funding a la Gitcoin)_\
   __Funding of early-stage carbon capture R\&D.

### Union Bonding

_AKA: Buy and Stake_

In a single transcendent DeFi meditation, bond FRAX for EDN at the Temple Market Price then bond EDN into the Temple Reserves for EDEN. The market price is a multiple of the Intrinsic Value (IV) defined by the Union Bonding Curve contract.

In the future, we will pave the way for Regens to perform Union Bonding at Bond Price. For this, we are exploring the use of _Isolated Debt Markets_. Regens bond FRAX directly with a project's CDRM to provide a line of credit to that project and mint EDN at Bond Price.

### Infinite Harvest

_AKA: Keep compounding and delight in EDEN-collateralized loans_

Down the line, we intend to find an elegant solution to offering EDEN-collateralized loans for token holders to unlock liquidity. We're particularly inspired by Alchemix.Fi and Sushiswap.
