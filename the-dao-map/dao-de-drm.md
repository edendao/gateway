Visualizing can be the first step to manifesting, so let's dream of massive amounts of future carbon mass. Future carbon mass can look like forests, fertilizer, or rocks. Or it can be carbon captured by algae to be sunk to the bottom of the sea. To learn more, check out [4.-a-new-hope.md](../welcome-to-the-dao/4.-a-new-hope.md "mention").





### The Great Carbon Rush

> The Dao de DRM manifests destiny: The Great Carbon Rush of the 21st Century

> Future Carbon = 21st Century Gold => Rush to Gobble Carbon

To play the game, we use DRM tokens. $1 USD can be deposited into the DRM contract to mint 1 DRM. DRM tokens can be continuously pledged to a variety of carbon projects, which will be sourced by the Carbon Council.&#x20;

You are free to withdraw your pledge and pledge it to another project. If you pledge towards a project that doesn't get qualified, you don't lose any money.

The Carbon Council will use the community's pledges to prioritize the deeper qualification of projects. Once qualified, the Dao de DRM will burn the project's pledged DRM and mint every DRM holder an EDN token at the Bond Price.

EDN can be bonded to the Temple Reserve in exchange for EDEN. EDEN receives compounding Harvest rewards. EDEN token holders have price exposure to the increasing price of carbon.

The Carbon Council will work with the project developer to tokenize their future CO2 as CDRM (Carbon Dioxide Removal Mass) tokens to be deposited into the Temple's Carbon Planetary Reserve. The Carbon Planetary Reserve is the natural asset vault that backs our reserve currency EDN.
