# ðŸ—º The Dao Map

We visit the Garden of Eden to tap into the Dao of Eden. The Dao of Eden is the energetic source from which we draw our visions for the future.&#x20;

The Dao of Eden is the creative vision of the GRDN of EDEN, the market is driven by the Dao de DRM, and the currency is managed by the Temple of EDEN.
