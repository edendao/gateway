# â˜¯ Eden Daoists

Eden Daoists practice our DeFi meditations to accelerate the decarbonization warp drive. They profit off the appreciation of the voluntary carbon offsets ([2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md](../welcome-to-the-dao/2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md "mention")).&#x20;

### Dao de DRM

_AKA The Great Carbon Rush_

_AKA Carbon Curation Markets_

This active strategy where you learn to manifest your DRMs of an unfucked planet into EDN at the Bond Price (BP).

$$
IV < BP < MP
$$

We're dreaming of strategies to curate carbon markets like:

1. _DRM RACE (Mirror.xyz-style WRITE RACE)_\
   Vote on project proposals with your DRM to see which rises to the top! The GRDN will prioritize the qualification of projects based on a qualitative assessment by the Carbon Council.
2. _Garden Meditation (1Hive Gardens Conviction Voting)_\
   __Fluidly reposition your DRM across projects to continuously signal your preferences.
3. _Angel Rounds (Quadratic Funding a la Gitcoin)_\
   __Funding of early-stage carbon capture R\&D

__

### Union Bonding

_AKA: Buy and Stake_

In a single transcendent DeFi meditation, bond FRAX for EDN at the Temple Market then bond EDN into the Temple Reserves for EDEN. EDN is purchased at the Market Price (MP), a multiple of the Intrinsic Value (IV).

In the future, we intend to launch _Isolated Debt Markets_ for Regens to mint EDN at Bond Price. Regens would be able to bond FRAX directly with a project's CDRM to provide a line of credit to that project.&#x20;

### Infinite Harvest

_AKA: Delight in EDEN-backed credit while you compound your EDN_

Down the line, we intend to find an elegant solution to offering EDEN-collateralized loans for token holders to unlock liquidity. We're particularly inspired by Alchemix.Fi and Sushiswap.
