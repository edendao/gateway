# ☀ DAO De DRM

I have a dream that one day we can proudly say that we gave the climate crisis all that we got.

> I decided to join the DAO after understanding the values, mission and intention of it. As a fellow solarpunk, I want more solarpunk ideas to flourish.\
> \
> — Manu (Founder @ DoinGud, Meta Cartel Ventures)



## SEASON 1: RACE

I dream that the different chains — ETH, MATIC, CELO, AVAX — participate in a positive-sum fundraising competition to unfuck the planet.

For every chain to have its own sovereign DRM DAO to pledge capital towards disrupting the voluntary carbon markets.

That carbon experts will rise to collaborate with us and flow capital to where it is most impactful.

**Only together can the DRM DAOs become the world's largest high quality carbon reserve.**

You get to be a part of history by asserting the people's agency to make a difference in the world.&#x20;

_We're going to make bold strokes to create a paradigm shift in carbon finance._

_We are going to regenerate earth together._

> This is at the forefront of bringing real innovation to investment in climate impact. The community is focused on overcoming a critical challenge in aggregating significant funding for innovative technologies and channeling that investment into the technologies and protects with the greatest promise of impact.

### How do I play?

Deposit to our [Syndicate DAO](https://app.syndicate.io/clubs/0x99d61e194b0b677fa0a8215ad00d852cddd4cd9f) on ETH.

_L2 deployments coming soon. We are all getting in on the ground floor._

1. 1 DRM token = 1 USD stablecoin
2. DRM tokens are purely governance tokens and non-transferrable
3. For diamond handers only — no rage quits (though we use a Gnosis Safe, so we could add it)
4. The fundraise is initially capped at $10M per chain
5. The team — DAO De GRDN — receives 10% of tokens

Initially, these tokens would be backed by the DRM DAO's reserve of high quality carbon removals, which are experiencing a supply squeeze right now. (See more: [2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md](the-potential/2.-fucked-carbon-markets.md "mention"))

> After spending the last year studying carbon removal, the one thing I'm sure of is that we're critically supply-constrained — because of an unprecedented swell of demand from governments and major corporations that need to fulfill their net-zero commitments, and because too many of the offsets in-market today have limited drawdown potential. The future of carbon markets is a multi-billion dollar industry of permanent, verifiable carbon removal projects like those in labs around the world today. The Eden Dao lets you get a discount on this future, while catalyzing the projects we urgently need to scale.\
> \
> — Lily (Principal @ [Wireframe VC](https://www.wireframevc.com/about))

The DRM DAOs is also a public community-style "party round" for anyone in the world to participate in. The Eden Dao is fundamentally _for the people_, and invites anyone to get in on the ground floor. _The community shares the same privileges as an investor, and vice versa._



### What will we do?

> If you can convince people to pay for the social price of future carbon up front you'll disrupt the market, upend existing mental models, and unlock scale for carbon removal projects.\
> \
> — Jim (Founder @ [The Future Forest Company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com))

> Stoked about this and the disruptive impact it will have on the growth rate of carbon removal technologies. This is the most epic thing happening in carbon markets right now!\
> \
> — Brandon (Product @ [Patch](https://patch.io))

We're going to explore and experiment with different models to help project developers scale by materializing their future revenue into the present.



## SEASON 2: BUILD

With the money there we can build the protocol to unlock capital efficiency and develop a cross-chain natural asset reserve currency for the planet.

1.  EDN can be minted by the DRM DAOs at a preferred rate or purchased at market price.

    Essentially, use the carbon reserves as 21st century gold to back EDN. Like an OlympusDAO, TempleDAO, or KlimaDAO.
2. Collateralize loans using EDN token
3. Isolated debt markets for carbon project developers
4. New carbon accounting visualization frameworks for carbon removals
